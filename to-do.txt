Celery Workers: The 
execute_workflow_task
 function exists but is called via asyncio.create_task (fire-and-forget in the same process) instead of a proper Celery worker. This is risky for long-running tasks.
Webhook Callback: The 
handle_workflow_callback
 function exists but the API endpoint to receive the callback (POST /api/v1/webhook/callback/{run_id}) is MISSING from the router.
Redis Integration: Redis is configured in 
.env
 but not actually used for a task queue yet.

 frontend :-
 Real-time Updates: The 
ExecutionDetail
 page uses polling (refresh every 3s). WebSockets would be better but polling is acceptable for MVP.
App Builder UI: There are 
AppBuilder.tsx
 and 
AppView.tsx
 files, but they seem experimental and not fully integrated with the main navigation.
